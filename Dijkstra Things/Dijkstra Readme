Here are my Dijkstra style algorithms, I am making these from scratch with only a graphical representation of concurrent Dijkstra to go off so I know this isn't exactly Dijkstra but thats what inspired it. Dijksta.py is finished, I know the code is very ineficcient but this was my first time using python since I was in year 10 so I was re learning everything as I went.
